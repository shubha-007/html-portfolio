<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>
  Welcome to my webpage!
</h2>
<p>Hello, I'm Shubha Roy, originally from the enchanting city of Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. I pursued my academic journey right here in Jabalpur, completing both my 10th and 12th grades locally. My passion for technology and engineering led me to the University of Calcutta, Kolkata, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Instrumentation Engineering from 2017 to 2021.</p>

<p>Currently, I am on an exciting path as I dedicate myself to preparing for the UPSC Civil Services Examination for the past two years. While the journey has been challenging and rewarding, my aspirations have expanded towards building a fulfilling career in the dynamic and ever-evolving IT industry.</p>

<p>My academic background in Instrumentation Engineering has equipped me with a strong foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking, skills that I believe are valuable assets in the IT landscape. As I embark on this new chapter, I am enthusiastic about leveraging my skills and knowledge to contribute meaningfully to the IT industry.</p>
<p>
  Join me on this journey as I strive to merge my technical expertise with the challenges and opportunities presented by the world of Information Technology. Together, let's explore the possibilities and create a pathway to a successful and fulfilling career in the IT sector. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing more about my experiences and achievements with you.
